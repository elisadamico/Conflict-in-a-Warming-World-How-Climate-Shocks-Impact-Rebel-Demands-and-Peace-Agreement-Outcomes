# Conflict in a Warming World: How Climate Shocks Impact Rebel Demands and Peace Agreement Outcomes

## Abstract
As climate change increases in frequency and severity, its impact on global conflict dynamics becomes increasingly critical. This paper investigates a pressing question: how do climate shocks influence rebel demands and violence, and are these evolving needs reflected in peace agreements? Climate shocks, often described as threat multipliers, exacerbate vulnerabilities in conflict-affected areas, potentially fueling demands for scarce resources like water, land, and natural resources.

By leveraging novel geospatial climatological and conflict data, this study tests two key hypotheses:
1. Climate shocks will escalate rebel demands for climate-related resources and intensify violence.
2. These escalating demands will lead to greater incorporation of water, land, and natural resource provisions in peace agreements.

Using 1-degree grid units and hexagonal climate shock buffer zones, this research employs EM-DAT and UCDP geocoded data along with Callaway and Sant’Anna’s (2020) double robust staggered treatment difference-in-differences methodology. This approach, which relies on parallel trends, allows us to isolate the effects of climate shocks on rebel activity and evaluate whether these demands are met in subsequent peace agreements. The findings offer crucial insights into how climate-induced pressures shape conflict dynamics and inform conflict resolution strategies in a warming world.

## Policy Report
This report was written for policy audiences and is intended to be accessible. A forthcoming academic iteration will also examine whether the lack of presence of environmental resource provisions in peace agreements leads to a shorter peace or peace failure through a Cox proportional survival model.
